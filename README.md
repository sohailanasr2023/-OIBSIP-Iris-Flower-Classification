# -OIBSIP-Iris-Flower-Classification
The iris flower classification problem is a well-known and widely used example in the field of machine learning. It involves predicting the species of iris flowers based on their measurements. Logistic regression is one of the popular algorithms used to tackle this classification problem.

Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is commonly used for binary classification tasks. However, it can also be extended to handle multi-class classification problems using techniques such as one-vs-rest or softmax regression. In the case of the iris flower classification, we have three classes: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

To apply logistic regression to the iris flower classification problem, we first need a
